# SpaceX-Falcon-9-first-stage-Landing-Prediction
For the capstone project for IBM's Data Science Professional Certificate, I'm playing the role of a data scientist at SpaceY who would like to compete with SpaceX. My job is to determine the price of each rocket launch. I will gather info about SpaceX, perform EDA and train a machine learning model to predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage.
